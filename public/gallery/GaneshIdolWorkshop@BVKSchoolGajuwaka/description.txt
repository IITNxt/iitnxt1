On 25-08-2025, IITNXT conducted a Live Hands-on Ganesh Clay Modelling Workshop at Vijnana Bharathi (BVK) School, engaging nearly 200 students in a creative and eco-conscious artistic experience. The workshop was led by professionals from the Fine Arts Department of Andhra University, and prizes were distributed to encourage young talent. The event promoted environmental responsibility through the use of natural clay while nurturing creativity and cultural values among students. Special thanks are extended to the RSS office team, our generous sponsors including Shri Vindu Kumar (GM, Himadri Chemicals), VVL Srinivas (Convener, Arogya Bharathi & Correspondent, BVK GWK School), Muslayya (BJP Mandal President), and Ajay (Alumnus of the school and Founder of Souls of Humanity) for sponsoring the prizes and supporting this impactful initiative.
